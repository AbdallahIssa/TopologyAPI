### General Information

- A topology is a set of electronic components that are connected.
- We want to provide the functionality to access, manage and store device topologies.
-  so this API can handle that by :
          * Reading and writing topologies to and from the disk.
          * Storing multiple topologies in memory.
          * Executing operations on topologies.
- Automated Testing is used to test the work of the existing functionalities.
- Take a look at [javadoc Documentaion](https://github.com/abdallahissa/TopologyAPI/tree/master/doc).


### Technologies Used

- Java Language with: 
    * OOP.
    * maven.
    * Javadoc.
    * JUnit 5.
    * Jackson Library for JSON manipulation.
  
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA.


### Usage

- You can just run the code and choose which operation you want to access within the topology.
